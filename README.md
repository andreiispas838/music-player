# Music player made using _React JS_ and _Tailwind CSS_

This was my first project made using **_Vite_** . I found this project really useful as it helped me go into more in-depth React principles and made me better understand the fundamental ones, such as **_hooks_**, **_state_**, **_props_** etc.

Initially I was eager to replace Youtube Music with this Music Player as I simply liked it better (+the satisfaction I got from making it). But as **_Shazam Core API_** is no longer free, I had to let go of that want.

Another API that I used is the **_IP Geolocation API_** which I needed in order to fetch top melodies in the user's country.

Thank you :)
